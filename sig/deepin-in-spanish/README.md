# Deepin en Español SIG

## SIG Description

International deepin community in Spanish propose deepin improvements and deepin Store development

## Goal

Expand the ecology of the new root community and provide more common apps and gadgets in the form of an app store to provide a better experience for users

Activities: Development, maintenance and communication via telegram groups, online communities, etc.
**SIG was created to facilitate the adaptation and development of the deepines store for deepin 23**.

## Charter

The Deepin en Español community strives to collect the software packages we all need, gather and create quality widgets, take the initiative to adapt them to applications using our app store to bring them together for everyone to access.

What it takes to build an ecosystem is not one party working alone, but everyone acting to contribute to the software ecosystem. We have created an app store to help users get Linux apps easily.

Considering the review environment of community volunteers ready to collaborate, currently our store only works for Debian packages, but in the future we plan to adapt it for linglong packages.
